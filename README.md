# My Pandas Cookbook
This is my personal, really stupid cookbook. It has the sole purpose of
keeping the knowledge in place that I'm acquiring over time.

## Running the Code
The cookbook uses pipenv. Go and get it using `pip3` and then run 
`pipenv install` in the checked out copy of this repo. Then just
fire up `jupyter notebook` and you're good to go.
